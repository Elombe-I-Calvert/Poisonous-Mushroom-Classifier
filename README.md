# Poisonous-Mushroom-Classifier
 **The Use of Machine Learning Algorithms to Classify Mushrooms as Either Poisonous or Edible, Given A Dataset Consisting of Different Attributes of Mushrooms Varieties**

**Introduction**
<div align="justify">Mushroom poisoning happens when a person consumes mushrooms that contain poisons while looking for benign, similar-looking mushrooms. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of a group of higher fungus that have developed for millions of years alongside plants (Horowitz et. al., 2019). According to Horowitz (2019), they are widely disseminated all across the globe. Although there are thousands of types of mushrooms, only around 100 elicit symptoms in humans when consumed, and only 15-20 mushroom species are potentially fatal. There is no easy way to tell the difference between edible and toxic mushrooms. Poisoning occurs in more than 95 percent of mushroom toxicity instances as a result of misidentification (Horowitz et. al., 2019). This predicament presents the perfect opportunity for machine learning algorithms to be used to make the distinction between poisonous and edible mushrooms.</div>
